{% include toc.html %}

I know that Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface is a manga that left a lot of readers confused (including myself). It is ridden with tech jargon, a lot of which seems correct, at least in the IT-sphere, so I can only assume that Shirow Sensei did a Herculean amount of research. I love the GITS series, so I want to share with you all this Reddit comment from user *kriskropd* (who I hope doesn't mind me sharing it), along with a link to the original post, AND the URL to a very rare interview with Shirow himself, at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!

spoilers

you've been warned

* * *

The story follows Motoko Aramaki (an anomaly of Motoko Kusanagi \[anomaly in the same way the Puppet Master from GITS:SAC:SSS is an anomaly of Motoko Kusanagi - the origin of these anomalies have never been clarified, but we as fans have theories\]).

M. Aramaki seems to be greedier than the original M. Kusanagi and very focused on managing her "business." She keeps a large collection of decots and aliases around the world to enable her to quickly present herself in that physical region as necessary.

* * *

Skipping ahead to the parts that probably were really confusing.

* * *

M. Aramaki is one of multiple isotopes - the "11th" according to Spica. I think Kusanagi uses Spica and Antares to hint directives to M. Aramaki, however I'm not sure if they are considered isotopes of M. Kusanagi as well (they seem to be).

It is revealed that M. Kusanagi has been researching machine life that could replace humans. This is relevant to Professor Rahampol because he designed the blueprint for a "highly intelligent silicon-based life form" and Motoko 11 brought his blueprint to Antares and Spica where M. Kusanagi then collected it. Shortly after, the real M. Kusanagi introduces herself to M. Aramaki and instead of fusing back together they continue on their seperate paths with a shared interest in the development of the blueprint that Antares and Spica began to simulate. My theory is that Shirow Masamune intended to link this to the bio-roids from his story Appleseed which occurs in generally the same universe not long after the events of GITS. Bio-roids might be classifed also as a "highly-intelligent silicone-based life" that "replaced humans with machine life." That's just my theory though - I don't think Shirow Masamune ever admitted it and there are several arguments against it including the re-arrangement of several chronologial events in the Appleseed timeline that differs from that of GITS.

* * *

Continuing on, we have the symbolism of the mythical Japanese creation story. Actually I'm not sure if this is based on the Kojiki or Shintoism or Buddhism or whatever as it's not something I've fully researched. Luckily, to understand the story, we just need to know it represents a new universe being formed within Tamaki in response to the simulation that Spica and Antares ran of the silicon based life form that began to expand. I can't explain "_How_," unfortunately. Tamaki apparently was observing it all and got caught up in it. \*shrug\* While Tamaki is watching Kusanagi's creation-simulation-thing, we do see she is represented as a tanuki raccoon and present during the bloom - just before she begins to "see double" and realizes there are two of her and that she is part of the mirror.

I know I probably didn't answer all of your questions. Frankly, this is the third or fourth time I've tried to help explain MMI's conclusion on this sub-reddit and I've yet to have anybody explain to me exactly how Tamaki fits in. She's sort of a character that just ties everything back to mythology and then the story concludes when apparently she does as well.

If it is any consolation - I don't think a lot of people understand the conclusion of MMI completely. I'm not even sure if Shirow just used it as an excuse to cut the series short while cramming in a ton of theoretical ideas he had about simulated life and trying to emphasize it as both spiritual and godlike.

* * *

**Tl;DR**

Section 9 investigates Professor Rahampul who intends to create machine life that competes-with/replaces humans and Motoko Aramaki not only assists him, but possibly was an indirect puppet for the original Motoko Kusanagi who is even more interested in finding this machine life. Section 9 resorted to consulting some techno-priests to assist in their investigation. From them, Aramaki concludes that in the near _future_ this "intelligent, artificial life" is a phenommenon the humans, as a whole, would have to confront. In response to Aramaki, the priest says the "past and the future are the same thing" and "the only difference is on the part of the perceiver" - implying it has already happened before (relatively) and will happen (relatively) again.
