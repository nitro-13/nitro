Just as the 16th-century astronomer **Nicolaus Copernicus** turned astronomy inside-out by hypothesizing that the earth moved around the sun, rather than the other way round — elegantly solving lots of problems by doing so — Kant turns our theory of knowledge inside-out by theorizing that **our minds conform not to reality, but that reality conforms to our minds**.*

*To adapt an example from the late philosopher Bryan Magee’s excellent 1999 book, [Confessions of a Philosopher](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375750363/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=philosophybre-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0375750363&linkId=596dfdfc7e47562aebc7063290597368): just as a photograph of a waterfall is not a waterfall, it’s a photograph; and just as a written description of a waterfall is not a waterfall, it’s a written description; and just as a sound recording of a waterfall is not a waterfall, it’s a sound recording: so our experience of reality is not reality, it’s experience.*
