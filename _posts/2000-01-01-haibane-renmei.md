Haibane Renmei watch diary/analysis (spoilers. obviously…)
============================================================



<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/1.png"/>

<center><i>the cast of Haibane Renmei</i></center>

I decided to watch **Haibane Renmei** after watching this wonderful short documentary that **Archipel** did on Yoshitoshi ABe, the illustrator behind Haibane Renmei and Serial Experiments Lain, among others. I love ABe a lot for his dream-like approach to art, his philosophy of focusing on the feeling of a scene, rather than the technical details, and his appreciation of failed attempts and their power to reveal more about the artist than finished pieces.

Haibane Renmei seems like a piece of media from a lost era, and in a way, it is: it predates the streaming revolution, a shift in how shows, both live-action and animated, are produced and distributed. While everybody applauded Netflix (and its inevitable copycats) for the convenience of launching all episodes of a show at once, the moment these platforms started creating their original shows was the moment that serialized fiction (and a whole generation of writers) was ruined. Content that is designed to be consumed in one go (**_binging_**) is produced and written the same way. Everything now is one big movie cut into eight to thirteen chunks, amorphous pieces that are borderline incoherent when watched by themselves.

Watching Haibane Renmei was a breath of fresh air. I watched the show over a few weeks, usually an episode a day, and often with a few days in between episodes, up until episode 9, where I started a short binge due to personal reasons (read below when you reach that point). I did not impose this routine on myself; rather, I never felt the need to consume this show like I was eating a greasy hamburger. The story is episodic, yet there is an overarching story arc. Most episodes can be watched stand-alone without any context of the bigger story, and all episodes can be rewatched alone after a full viewing of the series. They stand on their own through strong storytelling, choosing not to rely on the oldest and cheapest trick in television, ending the episode on a [cliffhanger](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger) to hook the audience for the next one. Even when plots remain unresolved, as in episode eight, there is no urgency to start the next episode right away.

Wikipedia summary:
==================

_Haibane Renmei (灰羽連盟, lit. "Charcoal Feather Federation")\[a\] is a 2002 Japanese anime television series based on an unfinished dōjinshi manga series by Yoshitoshi Abe, The Haibanes of Old Home (オールドホームの灰羽達, Ōrudo-hōmu no Haibane-tachi). The 13-episode series was directed by Tomokazu Tokoro, animated by Radix, and produced by Yasuyuki Ueda. It first aired on Fuji TV between October and December 2002, and was later broadcast on Animax Asia in English and French under the title Ailes Grises (Grey Wings)._

Episode 1:
----------

I loved the mood set by the first episode. It slowly drips enough exposition while leaving you intrigued enough for the next episodes.

I have a thing for dilapidated, European-style buildings. Stone walls, buildings with no roofs and empty windows or a crumbling wall, stuff like that. All surrounded by grassy hills. Looking up pictures of old churches in Ireland is literally porn for me.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/2.png"/>

<center><i>Pictured: porn</i></center>

I loved the whole subplot with the wings emerging, it’s pure fantasy yet I empathized with the character due to how realistic the whole range of emotions was portrayed, from the fear and anxiety of anticipating it to the feverish anguish of suffering through the process, to the terror, acceptance and, finally, wonder. The scene of washing the sticky blood off the wings had a hypnotic quality, it looked like a parent tending to a sick child or pet.

It is heavily telegraphed (and I admit I also saw it beforehand in the analysis section of the Wikipedia article) that the world of the story is sort of purgatory for people who committed suicide and the ‘dream’ they have while in the cocoon is related to their matter of death.

I loved the idea of ‘receiving a **halo**’ in the form of a forged ring and having it ‘stick’ after a while. This whole ritual part of welcoming a new angel mythologizes the whole world.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/3.png"/>

<center><i>I forgot to take screenshots for episode 1, so this one is from the internet. the rest are mine</i></center>

Episode 2:
----------

We open with the opening credits that play over a beautiful, celtic-inspired, violin-centric theme.

We’re treated to some wholesome scenes with **Rakka** (the protagonist) with the core cast and the kids from the town of **Glie**. She gets to wear a Franciscan monk-like robe for the first part of the episode and has to dry her wings in the sun (for some reason, this whole process keeps making me think of a baby animal). There’s also some more lore about the names, and one kid mentions he wants to be a carpenter, which is a bit on-the-nose symbolism. The building called **Old Home** was apparently a dormitory for a school that got vacated over time and became a home for the **_Haibane_**.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/4.png"/>

<center><i>windmills, as seen in episode 2</i></center>

The rest of the episode introduces the humans and the fact that they live in this universe alongside the Haibane (well, it’s more like the Haibane are tolerated there, with humans allowing them to use only items and clothes that have been used before, even if they do work in the walled town of Glie). While doing quite a lot of exposition, the episode is charming nonetheless and keeps the nostalgic and timeless vibe of the first episode. There’s also the revelation that humans and Haibane alike can’t leave past the walls that surround the town, that privilege is reserved for a select group, a religious cult-like organization called the **Toga**.

Probably the most important concept introduced in this episode is the titular **Haibane Renmei**, which is apparently an organization that protects the Haibane and gives them notebooks that, so far, I have seen them using as money.

If my impressions of this episode seem more like a list of plot elements, I’m sorry, but I‘m trying to explain the world to the readers of this article in hopes of piquing their interest in this series. I’ll try to stay more impression-focused for the rest of the episodes.

If there’s one thing to close this section on is that ABe seems to have a thing for crows. Can’t fault him, those birds are eerie, they’re like _instant atmosphere_.

Episode 3:
----------

This episode was pretty chill and uneventful, more slice-of-life than episode 2. Except for the intro at the Haibane Temple, there was little exposition here, so in hindsight I appreciate that they dumped most of it (so far at least) in the previous episodes.

There’s a line between Rakka and Ku while biking toward town that they could really fly if they believe it, and after seeing the Archipel video on ABe with clips from the show, I suspect this to be foreshadowing. If I'm right or wrong remains to be seen…

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/5.png"/>

<center><i>Haibane use bells on their wings to communicate within the temple</i></center>

The cutest thing in this episode was the way they used the halo mold to make doughnuts!

Episode 4:
----------

Quick note, I never skip [the OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztSVbXekz0Y); it SLAPS!!! Bless your heart, Kow Otani, for this, the Shadow of the Colossus OST, and much more!

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/6.png"/>

I loved the pacing and slightly moodier vibe of this episode! I recently saw the trailer for the Crow reboot that’s set to come out soon, so seeing a crow at the start of the episode reminded me of that (for better or worse), but it also reminded me of ABe’s undying love for his feathered friends.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/7.png"/>

<center><i>The reason I don’t use social media.</i></center>

This episode is full of archetypal elements, such as dreams, clocks, and birds, which makes for striking storytelling and atmosphere. It is a favorite of mine so far. It also revealed the trick for the episodic format of the show, set up in the previous episode: Rakka will accompany various Haibane and see which job she likes best. This episode focuses on Kana and her work at the town clockmaker, and her ambition to fix the Old Home clock tower.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/8.png"/>

<center><i>Good point!</i></center>

Episode 5:
----------

Just noticed during the intro that Glie, seen from above, looks like Paris with its radial design, minus the Arc de Triomphe.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/9.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/10.png"/>

This episode is an interesting one. It’s set in a library, and the central theme, once stripped of all plot elements, is the Genesis myth, or more broadly the history of humanity, and the way it may be reinterpreted and rewritten over time to suit the reader and its audience. A Haibane mentions that she and a fellow librarian found a book titled ‘The beginning of the world’, and it’s clearly a rendition of the Christian Genesis (shocker, given the characters and their halos, right?), but since the book was in a state of great wear and lacked much of its content, they settled on imagining the rest.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/11.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/12.png"/>

<center><i>Let there be light and stuff</i></center>

This episode also reveals that there are male Haibane around, and they live segregated from the female Haibane, in an abandoned factory (possibly a boarding school-like situation, but I wonder what the real-life reason was for this story decision? Too much drama would arise in this mellow slice-of-life perhaps, or ABe and the other creators didn’t feel like writing romance?).

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/13.png"/>

<center><i>a little on the nose, perhaps?</i></center>

The following piece of dialogue about the research Rakka does into the beginning of the world is the key to deciphering the meaning of this episode: _There are many stories in many places… but they’re all sort of similar in parts._ It’s worth remembering that [the **Bible**, **Torah**, and the **Quran** have a common trunk of events and characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_in_both_the_Bible_and_the_Quran). There’s also the fact that a [**planetary flood** similar to the one in the story of **Noah** is mentioned in the **Epic of Gilgamesh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth), one of the oldest pieces of fiction known to man. I won’t delve deep into religion as a subject, as that’s a topic for civil family diners and online discussions in the comment section of YouTube videos. I’ll simply mention that, throughout history, common patterns seemed to appear in the mythologies of various cultures, such as [**Sun worshipping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity).

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/14.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/15.png"/>

<center><i>see the paragraph above</i></center>

This episode takes the crown of ‘best episode so far’ from the previous one, by virtue of giving me so much fun trying to decipher its meaning. The moment Rakka whispers an ending that makes Nemu laugh and says that it was inspired by seeing her taking a nap, [I kinda got what kind of end Rakka had in mind for her version of the Genesis…](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream) Honestly, Nemu was right in laughing it off and calling that trope classless, yet I still see it in stories in the year of our Lord 20xx.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/16.png"/>

<center><i>God and Hajime Isayama have that in common</i></center>

The brilliance of this episode is that it pretty much gives us the backstory of the world in the form of a theory created by the characters. While it aligns with what we’ve seen so far, it still leaves the lore open to interpretation, which is a very bold and smart thing to do!

Episode 6 (some big spoilers from this point forward):
------------------------------------------------------

A quick observation based on my experience so far, but the audio mixing is REALLY good! From the sound of the wind, crickets chirping at night, paper crinkling, bells ringing, thunder, rain, wooden doors creaking, and so on, it goes a long way to set the mood and make the world believable. I’m someone who’s very focused on the sensorial experience, it’s what I like to watch, read, and listen to, the **texture** of things, and in that regard, Haibane Renmei does not disappoint!

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/17.png"/>

We learn that winter is coming (I swear I’m not trying to make a lame GOT pun), with Rakka noticing that it was warm until recently, which makes me think that time operates in a different way in the world of the Haibane.

There’s something going on with Kuu in this episode, foreshadowed a bit in the previous episode as well, but I’ll get into that later.

First, I was glad to see some payoff to the clocks storyline in episode 4, Kana managed to fix the bell in the clock tower, only to have it ring constantly, much to everyone’s despair (got a good chuckle over that, yet it was the only moment of levity in the whole episode).

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/18.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/19.png"/>

<center><i>there’s something about that mid-2000s sepia, washed-out look that I love, and can’t believe it disappeared from all media</i></center>

The disappearance of Kuu and the mysterious behavior of the young character led to another important piece of lore.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/20.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/21.png"/>

The revelation of this moment is bittersweet and very smartly played; instead of showing the events, we are put in the shoes of the other Haibane who slowly realize the fact that one of them is gone. The **Day of Flight** event in the life of a Haibane implies that those wings do eventually serve their purpose.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/22.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/23.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/24.png"/>

<center><i>Day of Flight legend</i></center>

A nice reincorporation of the bell in the tower is used as a means to guide the Haibane out of the forest. This episode is very smartly written and directed, dealing with setup, payoff, emotion, stakes, and mood in an exemplary way, knowing what to show, what to imply, and what to hold back.

The music was the star of the second part of the episode, way more somber, but grandiose and somewhat gothic. A very strong, bitter-sweet episode, it doesn’t take the crown from episode 5, but I can see myself rewatching it even if I’m not binging the whole series.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/25.png"/>

<center><i>Goodbye, Kuu</i></center>

Episode 7:
----------

An interesting choice for this episode is to cold open directly continuing the storyline from episode 6, instead of kicking off with the OP and a new plot thread. It’s a short sort-of resolution, but nice nonetheless.

Rakka keeps talking to Kuu while cleaning her room in her absence, as this episode tackles the way people deal with grief.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/26.png"/>

The act of cleaning an empty, unused room, one month after the ‘passing’ of Kuu, reminds me of a cool story our philosophy teacher told us in high school. In Eastern Christian households, there’s the custom of [almsgiving in the name of the deceased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alms#In_Eastern_Christianity), basically offering food that the deceased loved to others so that he or she can receive it in the next life. Similar offerings for the dead exist in other religions, with the Japanese for instance often dedicating a small altar for the dead within the household and offering them small servings of the current meal served. The teacher told us that, long before realizing the concept of death as a different state from sleep, humans used to hunt together in packs and share the spoils, and even if a member of the pack died, that member would still receive his share, until his body decayed to the point of not being recognizable. This accidental custom evolved into the way the dead are often commemorated even to this day, with practices such as sharing some drink or food in the name of those long gone. In this day and age when death is better understood as a concept, this practice could more likely be a mixture of upholding tradition and relying on it as a coping mechanism.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/27.png"/>

<center><i>Rakka starts developing charcoal-stained wings in this episode</i></center>

The eponymous ‘charcoal wings’ start getting new importance in this episode, with various shots of Rakka’s wings getting stained by dark spots. It could very well be a symptom of her grief, as she’s the only Haibane that’s still hung up on Kuu’s death, and unable to process her grief properly.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/28.png"/>

The mold-like disease starts spreading across Rakka’s wings, and she attempts to contain and hide it by clipping her wings, a desperate act that could be an analog for self-harm.

We also learn about the existence of an old tree near the walls, and my mind immediately goes to the [Tree of Life archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life), but it remains to be seen if it was just a one-off mention or something more significant.

Reki, the old sister of the Old Home, reveals that she too had the moldy feathers in the beginning, and along with her backstory which I won’t spoil, details the way that she differs from the other Haibane, unable to remember their cocoon dream or ever leave this world.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/29.png"/>

<center><i>the existence of sin-bound Haibane is revealed</i></center>

Episode 8:
----------

The only episode with a single title, as it deals with a single, strong theme. It opens up with a continuation of the plot thread from episode 7.

Rakka seems plagued by some existential questions about life’s meaning as a Haibane in this episode, and the heavy atmosphere is sustained by the droning sound of the wind howling, a sort of white noise that keeps playing in the background.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/30.png"/>

<center><i>Crows show up again, this time frightening Rakka. In previous episodes, she showed herself much more open to their presence, but now they took an ominous quality, closer to their archetype of Death heralds</i></center>

We learn from the town tailor that Haibane are seen as a good-luck charm or a sign of good fortune for the people of Glie, one woman even getting excited over seeing Rakka. This deeply upsets her, as she sees her existential crisis worsened by being reduced to a token. She also buys a new **red** coat, which will come into play later after the ordeal in this episode.

After seeing her wings get blacker and blacker, I think the symbolism finally clicked for me (a bit late, but I guess I am slow about things like these sometimes). Rakka might be scared by the crows because her own feathers are turning to their color. I wondered if one of the paths that Haibane can take if corrupted by negative thoughts, is to turn into crows, reduced to a more animalistic form of existence, one that is governed by fear and instinct, as opposed to ration. If the world of Glie is supposed to give Catharsis to Haibane, to clean them emotionally so they can pass on (kinda like Ku did), then being saddled with more anguish could condemn them to a lower form of existence?

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/31.png"/>

Rakka is called into the Western Woods by the crows. As established in the previous episodes, Haibane are forbidden from entering them, as they can easily get lost without something to guide them back. The incursion takes on the [Jungian theme of gazing into the Abyss](https://qr.ae/pssgEk).

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/32.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/33.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/34.png"/>

<center><i>…and the Abyss gazes back</i></center>

I won’t spoil the rest of the episode but rest assured, the descent into Abyss theme keeps going, along with a recontextualization of the opening scene of the anime. There’s a well and a bird skeleton that Rakka thinks it _‘took a different form this time’_ and takes the time to bury. I still don’t have all the puzzle pieces, but my guess is that she is burying her former self, a sort of rite of passage if you will. Emerging from the Abyss does have the benefit of catharsis, and of forging a better self. This is strengthened by the imagery of the first snow. I feel like this rebirth arc is concluded with this episode, after having started with Ku’s departure.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/35.png"/>

<center><i>The Abyss</i></center>

I found myself keep hitting pause and jotting down notes, which ruined my viewing experience a bit, but I couldn’t help myself. I will definitely rewatch this whole anime at some point, without the burden of taking notes for the first time.

Episode 9:
----------

Ok, breezing through these last episodes faster since I start a new job tomorrow after some time off and I want to finish the series before I get the chance to put it on hold. I kinda broke my rule about binging (and killed some of the enjoyment) but I need to be an adult, even against my will :(

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/36.png"/>

The episode starts with Rakka being saved by two Toga members from inside the well. She then ventures to the wall, hearing Kuu’s voice, then is led back by the leader of the Toga who, surprisingly, speaks to her directly (I guess it’s harder to do exposition any other way)

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/37.png"/>

Rakka explains her dream and the fact that the bird she grieved so hard for was someone she knew, who cared for her when she felt so alone that she could disappear. Up until this point, I felt like the story could be an allegory for purgatory, yet the Toga leader reassures Rakka that she has no sin to atone for _in this world_. Isn’t the point of that world to cleanse oneself of sin, until their Day of Flight? This starts to get muddy, but fortunately, the elder Toga gives Rakka (and us) some food for thought in the form of the **Circle of Sin riddle.** The answer, as the Toga said, must be found by the individual seeking it. [It does remind me of old observations about life that saint-philosophers like Augustine of Hippo made in their attempt to decipher the often philosophical themes of religion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Trinity)

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/38.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/39.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/40.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/41.png"/>

Then, more rebirth symbolism follows, some more subtle, some more direct.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/42.png"/>

The most interesting development is that Rakka is cured of her ‘sin’ in the woods, and after breaking into a fever and falling asleep, Reki shows that she seems to regret this development, perhaps because she is, once again, alone in that predicament. Despite all the help she provided, she couldn’t help but feel ashamed of that feeling of regret.

Episode 10:
-----------

[First, I recommend reading this Wikipedia article about the color **red** and its symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_in_culture). An excerpt that I found relevant:

_In the Shinto religion of Japan, the gateways of temples, called torii, are traditionally painted vermilion red and black. The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place. The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red (and usually only temple bridges are red, not bridges in ordinary gardens), since they are also passages to sacred places. Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease._

We open with Reki’s backstory and her Haibane ‘childhood’, being ostracized by the other Haibane (including Nemu) for being born with black-tainted wings.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/43.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/44.png"/>

The guardian of the Haibane kids, a Haibane woman named Kuramori, protects Reki in scenes that mirror Reki’s relationship with Rakka. It is clear that we’re meant to contrast the inevitable difference between the two stories, the fact that Reki felt betrayed by Kuramori’s disappearance, becoming jaded after pinning all her hopes on one person only to be let down.

Also interesting is the fact that Reki was **given** the job of looking after newborn Haibane by Kuramori. It might seem like an insignificant detail, but I think it is key to her incurable condition. Despite having a good heart, Reki does not do what she does because one day she felt like it is her calling to be the big sister; it is the inertia of a job trusted upon her. She did not make an emotional or spiritual breakthrough during her time in Glie. She seems to be a caring person, but a person who takes her life one day at a time, with little reflection over past events.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/45.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/46.png"/>

<center><i>an interesting exchange</i></center>

We also learn that there is a fate awaiting Haibane who spend too long in that world and do not reach their Day of Flight, such as sin-bound Reki. That fate is not made clear yet.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/47.png"/>

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/48.png"/>

Rakka is ordered by the Toga to receive punishment, much to Reki’s disapproval, yet she goes to return the staff with a light heart and a smile on her face, symbolizing a transcended state. (Even if she no longer needs the staff to support herself, she holds it in her hand, reminiscent of religious figures)

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/49.png"/>

<center><i>See? That red coat storyline finally paid off!</i></center>

For punishment, Rakka is taken inside the walls, where a river flows, illuminated by plants that emit bioluminescent light. The trip resembles a Stix River journey. The payoff is that Rakka finally gets her job.

<center><i>getting a job is hard these days</i></center>

Episode 11:
-----------

So, it seems that there _are_ girl Haibane in the Abandoned Factory, after all.

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/56.png"/>

<center><i>they look like a Haibane K-Pop group</i></center>

After some shenanigans and while doing her job within the wall (and almost getting lost, because most plot developments seem to rely on Rakka having the whimsical clumsy personality of a Disney princess with a concussion), she hears laughter and sees ripples mimicking footsteps on the surface of the river. This immediately made me wonder if the walls are like a barrier zone between the world of the living and the purgatory-like Glie.

In a conversation with the old Toga, we find out that, after the seven years of not achieving the spiritual cleansing on the Day of Flight, Reki might be condemned to remain in Glie forever.

It seems like Reki will have to live the rest of her days as neither human, nor Haibane, grow old and eventually die (the logistics of that seem puzzling for the moment, but I suppose it will be like going into nothingness).

<center><i>the ‘fossil’ of a book turned to stone. the ossification of dogma and knowledge, perhaps?</i></center>

Reki and Rakka have a short, philosophical discussion after Rakka laments that _today_ couldn’t be every day so nothing would ever change. Reki rightfully retorts that all things end and it is in that finality that _today_ gets meaning and value. A very Buddhist view of the world.

One thing that I started to think about in this episode, now considering the purgatory theory: the ‘living’ people, the non-Haibane, non-Toga people, are there for what? Do they represent people who passed on peacefully? Are they people that Haibane knew in the previous world? I wonder if it will be explained, or even hinted at.

The episode ends on an ominous note, with Reki seemingly ready to _end it_, whatever that means, but she is clearly at peace with her fate.

Episode 12:
-----------

One of the three titles of this episode is _Reconciliation_, and that is one of the themes, a bitter-sweet reconciliation between Reki and the Haibane in her life, due to her time rapidly approaching. We also learn more about her backstory, which I won’t spoil.

<center><i>I’ll leave this here, though; a different, more usual meaning bound to the color red</i></center>

Rakka also receives a ‘real name’, along with a new tag, in this episode. It might symbolize the end of her rebirth journey, as she is ready to shed the old name, thus the old life she had before death and rebirth through the well in the previous episodes. While Rakka is advancing through her journey as a Haibane, the path is mirrored by Reki who downgraded from stagnating to regressing, accepting her fate and preparing for the bad end of a Haibane’s life.

<center><i>names have a powerful spiritual charge, as they directly bind a person to a symbolic meaning</i></center>

Rakka seems to make a breakthrough and understand the meaning of the _Circle of Sin_ riddle, in that one cannot forgive oneself, but be forgiven after being of help to others. This philosophy I can’t say I 100% agree or disagree with, but it seems very fitting of a work made by Japanese creators. Japan has a culture of the group over the individual, and they were actually successful in implementing it.

<center><i>Haibane snowman. Unimportant to the plot, but cute!</i></center>

There’s a beautiful New Year tradition in Glie, and my favorite piece of worldbuilding: Haibane use acorn-like colored nuts between the two bell ringing on New Year to express different feelings to different people or other Haibane, with each color signifying a different feeling (red is specifically named as the color of gratefulness). It is a sweet scene that serves as payoff to a few smaller plot lines in the story.

<center><i>THANK YOU! FINALLY, SOMEONE SAID IT!</i></center>

The episode ends with Reki reconciling with the Abandoned Factory Haibane, and with a beautiful scene that almost made me cry, and the very last shot is the second-best pan to the stars I ever saw ([sorry, but Cowboy Bebop and that _Space Lion_ track are still number one](https://youtu.be/hARDe8LY5lo?si=Jb_8ZeH_WdtkKhk_&t=243))

Episode 13:
-----------

<img  width="600vw"  src="{{ site.url }}/assets/img/articles/haibane-renmei/63.png"/>

After seeing the harrowing painted room that Reki claims represents her cocoon dream, learning her real name, revealed by the Toga, means _‘to be run over’_, and her admission that _‘this is where I abandoned myself’_, it’s pretty clear now that Reki died by suicide, most likely ran over by a train.

<center><i>The true Reki is revealed</i></center>

Reki does a nasty performance that manages to tear the stubborn Rakka away, but I suspect those were mostly her genuine emotions, as they were hinted at throughout the show. Reki might not be a bad person, but she is not really a good one either. Rather, she is flawed, hurt, and realistic.

<center><i>Speaking with the child self; a sign of dissociation or simply an artistic device to show the death of innocence?</i></center>

In the end, Reki chose to ask for help, getting saved by Rakka, and forgiven of her sin.

Final thoughts
--------------

In the end, Haibane Renmei was as much Reki’s story as it was Rakka’s, because it was a story of propping each other up. Instead of codependence, if the feelings are sincere, we can provide each other salvation. Each person has the power to be a guardian angel to someone else.

There is a beautiful allegory that says Heaven and Hell are identical places, large rooms with endless feast tables, where the people eat with long spoons. The only difference lies in the hearts of the people at the table; in Hell, their hearts are full of envy and hatred, and they starve, even with delicious soup right in front of them, because the spoon handles are too long and they spill all the soup before they have a chance to eat anything. The people in Heaven are happy and their bellies are full because they feed each other.
