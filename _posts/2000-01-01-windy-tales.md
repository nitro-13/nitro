# Windy Tales soothes my heart

*flying cats and mellow vibes*

Do you have a piece of media that is your ‘_comfort thing_’ during times when you feel emotionally exhausted? I have a few, some stranger than others, some more obscure, and the latest in my collection is a beautiful slice-of-life anime called Windy Tales.

I discovered **Windy Tales** through a video done by Toco Toco (rebranded as Archipel) about the great Japanese composer Kenji Kawai. I loved Kenji’s work ever since I first saw **Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell** (this topic will get a separate article, as I have an obsession-level love for **Shirow Masamune**’s cyberpunk universe). The Ghost in the Shell OST, with its eerie choir of women singing traditional Japanese, and those droning drums, made for a fantastic and haunting experience, one that is in part successful because it’s not what you would expect from a cyberpunk OST (using synths and beeping computer noises is cool and all but most people aren’t **Vangelis**, sorry). **Yoko Kanno** herself did a fantastic job on the Stand Alone Complex soundtracks, but I feel like she never really reached the peak of Kawai.

So when, in the video, Kenji Kawai said that he is most proud of his work on **Windy Tales**, a soundtrack where he achieved his dream of creating music so beautiful that it’s scary, I was naturally intrigued. Something that topped his work on Ghost in the Shell? And an obscure anime, at that? I was intrigued, and the premise wasn’t half bad, so I decided to check it out.

And you know what? After watching Windy Tales, I’d say that he’s right. But not only the soundtrack is so beautiful that it’s scary; the whole experience is.

While Windy Tales is pretty episodic, each chapter handling a more-or-less self-contained story, the main hook of the show is the existence of the so-called _wind manipulators_, people who can use their connection with nature to harness the power of the wind, **Last Airbender** style. The wind itself is beautifully rendered in the show as multicolored strands describing currents, vortexes, and waves that wash over, through, and with the world.

The main characters are **Nao**, a very endearing girl with a passion for photography (particularly clouds), **Miki**, her best friend and the other member of the photography club, and **Jun**, an energetic and kind-hearted classmate. While most characters are pretty episodic, it’s common to spot the flying cats and the math teacher, **Mr. Taiki**, or **Ryouko**, another student, both wind manipulators already by the time the story starts. There’s also a plethora of cute cats that float around on wind currents!

*the main trio*

The start of the show is quite striking, and while I won’t spoil much, I’d say that once the trio gets to the Japanese countryside in search of their teacher, we are treated to some of the greatest imagery, music, and storytelling in the show. Windy Tales is not heavy on lore, but what little it has, it ‘_dumps_’ in the first episode in quite a masterful way. It is a bittersweet introduction to the world of the wind manipulators.

From then, the story gets fairly episodic, with varying degrees of quality, although you would be hard-pressed to find a ‘bad’ episode. My lowest-rated episode would be the tenth which, while having a clever premise, didn’t really work for me as well as the others, although it left a character’s actions ambiguous and had faith that the viewers would piece things together and figure out how a kid would act in such a situation.

The best episode, edging the first by a small margin, would be episode five, **_School Infirmary Story_**, about **Mr. Makino**, a geography teacher who entertains his students with scary stories and does the childish thing of acting sick during recess to go to the infirmary and avoid the other teachers. There, he stumbles upon Nao, who’s sick with a fever, and to keep her entertained, he describes the joys of traveling alone to strange and foreign lands. This sequence plays over Nao’s fevered dream, an interpretation of Mr. Makino’s words, wonderfully complemented by the soundtrack. It is an episode worth seeing by itself, and I won’t cheat you out of the experience, but I’ll leave Mr. Makino’s monologue here just because it is one of the finest pieces of writing I ever heard, and the greatest description of the joy and excitement of traveling:

**Nao:** You waited for the sunset for six days?  
**Mr. Makino:** Stupid, right?
**Nao:** I’ve never done anything like that.  
**Mr. Makino:** You have a chance to do it.  
**Nao:** How can I do it?  
**Mr. Makino:** First, you must think of going,  
then you pack your luggage.  
Where do you want to go?  
What do you want to do?  
Set your own travel plan.  
For hotels, cheap ones are fine.  
Showers don’t always work in some places.  
In others, sand comes out along with the hot water.  
The single beds in those hotels are around the size of this one.  
That’s why I’m lying on the bed here, curling up my legs.  
I can quietly feel those directionless vacations returning.  
The pitch black outside the window.  
A night without stars.  
The cries of animals and chirps of insects can be heard wherever you are.  
Remnants of light scatter over the water after a storm.  
Mud upon the river, like melted rust.  
The golden seaweed floating on top of the water.  
Large brightly colored flowers alongside the road.  
Tall coconut trees filled with bitter juice.  
Summer air, damp air, and a car’s exhaust.  
And also the mutter of unknown speech.  
The people that walk about don’t care.  
I start to sweat since I’m not used to the weather.  
Large sweatdrops flow from my neck to my waist.  
Pressing onward while drinking warm, sweet cola.  
The unidentified multi-colored birds,  
flying between the tree branches.

Animation is a wonderful medium because it requires a greater skill in observing day-to-day life. You can’t just prop up a camera, hit ‘record’, and call it a day, you need to design each and every element of the mise-en-scene. One could argue that every choice in animation is intentional, there are no ‘happy accidents’, or not on the scale that one can find in live-action.

There is [a great **Roger Ebert** interview with **Hayao Miyazaki**](https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hayao-miyazaki-interview) about the concept of **_Ma (negative space)_**. Miyazaki and Ebert spoke about those moments of tranquility, the tiny actions such as stretching your back after sitting on a chair for too long, or wiping a pair of foggy glasses when it’s cold outside. Those moments show a great degree of empathy from the director and the animation staff because they are not plot-related, so they are added out of love for the world they are creating. Animation is not as utilitarian as live-action. You will find such care for the little moments in Windy Tales. In fact, I’ll go as far as to say that Windy Tales is 80% _Ma_.

There is no great overarching story in Windy Tales. The anime starts at one point in the characters’ lives and exits at another. One could say that the story becomes pointless, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. It is in this format that the creators breathe life into their fictional world, making us believe that it existed before the first scene, and will continue to exist after the last. Unsurprisingly, Windy Tales, like most Japanese, Korean, and Chinese stories, follows the [Kishotenketsu story format](https://lunalane.art/why-japanese-storytelling-is-so-different-compared-to-the-west/#post-images-1), as opposed to a three-act structure (rest assured, the story is wrapped with a sweet little bow that will leave you with that longing feeling that all good stories do when they end). Personally, I’m biased toward this story structure, not that the typical three-act, hero’s journey structure of the Western media is wrong. If we can divide a year into spring, summer, autumn, and winter, we can divide a story into four and find balance and beauty in that.

(A kind reminder that Shakespeare, arguably the most famous writer of the English language, wrote his plays using a FIVE act structure).

*Cherry blossoms, as seen in episode 12*

There is something beautiful about Windy Tales that cannot be put into words. Its art seems crude at first, but it’s elegant in its minimalistic approach, simple by design (this is a Production I.G. anime, so I doubt resources were scarce). It looks the way it looks, it sounds the way it sounds and it plays the way it plays because it’s the best way to tell this story. It is art in its optimal form for the narrative it portrays; just like you couldn’t picture a better tool to eat soup than a spoon, you couldn't find a superior version of this anime. It does what peak art does best, hiding all the seams and making the end product appear fully realized, a cohesive experience and not a sum of its parts.

If all this sounds even remotely interesting to you, I deeply encourage you to watch Windy Tales. At the time of writing this article, Windy Tales was available in DVD format on Amazon, but sadly I could find no (legal) streaming option. I fully intend to buy the DVD, yet I fear that this will not support the creators, as all DVDs are resells at this point, at least in the West. If possible, track the current works of people who participated in the creation of the anime and support those.
